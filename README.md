# Keras CNN classifier</br>
Use Keras(based on Tensorflow) to build a Convolutional Neural Network,
and apply it on the handwrite numbers(0~9) recognition(use MNIST database)

The code structure is based on MorvanZhou tutorials
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mpDXAXFkfg)

Used 2 conv layers, 3 relu layers, 2 max pool layers, 2 dense(fully connected) layers.

After training 1 epoch (60,000 images), achieve 97.6% accuracy over 10,000 testing images
